* Remove consecutive duplicates
  Write a function that takes a list of numbers and a limit, and returns a list where consecutive runs of duplicates of length exceeding the limit have been removed entirely.
  Things to bear in mind:
- Non-consecutive duplicates are fine
- Consecutive duplicates exceeding the limit in the output are fine
- Memory and compute constraints (within reason) are not important, at least at first
